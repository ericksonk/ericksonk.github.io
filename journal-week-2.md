During week 2 at The Iron Yard we started to explore "the DOM" and got to see how JavaScript interacts in a browser. We also tackled Events and Event types. Our assignments consisted of using Javascript to manipulate the DOM.

Over the course of the past week, I've become more comfortable with writing pseudo code and have seen how it benefits me-- especially while taking on a large assignment. I also became very comfortable with using `querySelector()` `querySelectorAll()` to target desired elements. I particuarly enjoy using `querySelectorAll()` to create a Nodelist and then writing a for-loop to run through each item in that Nodelist. I also feel comfortable with assigning event listeners.

Naturally, as this is a "bootcamp", just as I've finally started to grasp a concept and feel comfortable with it, we're moving on to the next thing! I'm excited to take on CSS and jQuery this week as well as refine what I have already learned.
