During week 2 at The Iron Yard we started to explore "the DOM" and got to see how JavaScript interacts in a browser. We also tackled Events and Event types. Our assignments consisted of using Javascript to manipulate the DOM.

Over the course of the past week, I've become more comfortable with writing pseudo code and have seen how it benefits me-- especially while taking on a large assignment. Instead of trying to write one giant block of code that runs perfectly, pseudo code helps me break down the problem into smaller pieces and work on it one _small_ step at a time. I've also gotten into the habit of writing comments next to each line of code to better comprehend my thought processs. 

While completeing the weekend assignment, I became very comfortable with using `querySelector()` and `querySelectorAll()` to target desired elements. Specifically, I had a lot of success using `querySelectorAll()` to create a Nodelists, assignming Event Listeners and then writing for-loops.

Naturally, as this is a "bootcamp", just as I've finally started to grasp last week's concepts and feel comfortable with them, we're moving on to the next thing! I'm excited to take on CSS and jQuery this week, as well as refine what I have already learned.
