## p1: Fixed Mindset  vs. Growth Mindset
Producing confident learners comes from praising the process they engage in, as opposed to rewarding their "intelligence".
* -Growth Mindset- When you praise people's effort they become enthusiastic & responsible; believe intelligence can be developed, success comes from effort & hard work.
* -Fix Mindset- You are born gifted/ traits are set in stone; you're either good at something or you're not; creates joyless achievement

In _The Growth Mindset_, Carol Dweck talks about different approaches to learning. She notes that the current approach to rewarding students based on their grades and their precieved intelligence creates a _fixed mindset_. When you praise a student for getting a good grade and punish a student for a bad grade, this starts to create the notion that you are born with gifted and your traits are set in stone. In other words, you are either good at something or you're not.

## p2: Personal Experiences
* Fixed Mindset- Didn't do well in Spanish in high school, believed i just wasn't good at learning laguages; continued to do poorly.
* Growth Mindset- Took Spanish in College and excelled bc I put more effort into studying/asking questions.

## p3: Applying Growth Mindset to TIY
* Just because I may struggle with all these new concepts at first doesn't mean I won't be good at it.
* The more effort I put into this program, the more I will get out of it.
* Work in groups/get help from peers & instructors/ask questions
