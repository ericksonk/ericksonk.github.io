## p1: Fixed Mindset  vs. Growth Mindset
Producing confident learners comes from praising the process they engage in, as opposed to rewarding their "intelligence".
* -Growth Mindset- When you praise people's effort they become enthusiastic & responsible; believe intelligence can be developed, success comes from effort & hard work.
* -Fix Mindset- You are born gifted/ traits are set in stone; you're either good at something or you're not; creates joyless achievement

## p2: Personal Experiences
* Fixed Mindset- Didn't do well in Spanish in high school, believed i just wasn't good at learning laguages; continued to do poorly.
* Growth Mindset- Took Spanish in College and excelled bc I put more effort into studying/asking questions.

## p3: Applying Growth Mindset to TIY
* Just because I may struggle with all these new concepts at first doesn't mean I won't be good at it.
* The more effort I put into this program, the more I will get out of it.
* Work in groups/get help from peers & instructors/ask questions
