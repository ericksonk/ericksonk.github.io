## p1: Fixed Mindset  vs. Growth Mindset
Producing confident learners comes from praising the process they engage in, as opposed to rewarding their "intelligence".
* -Growth Mindset- When you praise people's effort they become enthusiastic & responsible; believe intelligence can be developed, success comes from effort & hard work.
* -Fix Mindset- You are born gifted/ traits are set in stone; you're either good at something or you're not; creates joyless achievement

In _The Growth Mindset_, Carol Dweck talks about different approaches to learning. She notes that the current approach to rewarding students based on their grades and their precieved intelligence creates a _fixed mindset_. When you praise a student for getting a good grade and punish a student for a bad grade, this starts to create the notion that you are born gifted and your traits are set in stone. In other words, you are either good at something or you're not. This fixed kind of mindset tends to discourage students from putting any effort into their work who have been told they are "not smart".

Instead, Dr. Dweck suggests using the _growth mindset_ approach. She explains that producing confident learners comes from praising the process they engage in. This implies that intelligence can be developed. When students are praised for their effort, they become more enthusiastic and responsible. Students try harder because they see that success comes from effort and hard work.
