In _The Growth Mindset_, Carol Dweck talks about different approaches to learning. She notes that the current approach to rewarding students based on their grades and their perceived intelligence creates a _fixed mindset_. When you praise a student for getting a good grade and punish a student for getting a bad grade, this starts to create the notion that you are born gifted and your traits are set in stone. In other words, you are either good at something or you're not. This fixed kind of mindset tends to discourage students whose grades have suffered from continuing to put effort into their work.

Instead, Dweck suggests using the _growth mindset_ approach. She explains that producing confident learners comes from praising the process they engage in. When students are praised for their efforts, they become more enthusiastic and responsible. Students try harder because they see that success comes from effort and hard work. This implies that intelligence can be developed and is not a "trait" that you are born with.

**Raise your hand if you've been personally victimized by a fixed mindset**
In high school I took Spanish II. I struggled throughout the semester and received my first "D" ever. I was convinced I simply just "wasn't good" at learning foreign languages and frequently used that excuse whenever discussing class with friends. I avoided taking any other language classes because I just assumed I would do terrible.

However, when college rolled around and I declared my Communication major, I was required to take two years of a foreign language. While this terrified me, I decided I wasn't going to let Spanish destroy my soul like it had done so many years before. I told myself that if I put in the effort to study and asked questions, things would be different. By switching my perspective to the growth mindset I soon found out that hard work does pay off. I got "A"'s in both Spanish I and Spanish II and continue to speak great Spanglish to this day.

In order to approach Cohort 5 at The Iron Yard with a growth mindset, I need to first accept that things are going to be difficult. I am going to be exposed to new concepts daily and just because I may struggle at first, doesn't mean I won't eventually be good at it. I understand that the more effort I put into this program, the more I will get out of it. I plan on asking for help from my peers and instructors, working in groups and asking plenty of questions when things are getting rough. The important thing is to remember the end result to motivate me to continue to work hard.
