### Me as Team Lead
* Difficult because I wasnt able to code and fix the things I wanted to fix
* A bit awkward- I was supposed to be team lead thurs night but every one didnt start working on their features until Friday morning, and Friday ended up not being very productive, so I was team lead until they finished those features, and that ended up running into Saturday
 - was able to assist with styling the Listing Options feature and provide a reference to the Etsy API

### Working with Team Lead
* Jasmine bought us pizza
* Our team mostly worked independently, we got together a couple hours each day to assign features and layout our plan (what branches and files we were working on).
  - would message each other if we ran into issues or had questions
