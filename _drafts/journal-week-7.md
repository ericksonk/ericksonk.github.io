Last week we faced a new challenge of working in groups _and_ as a class on the same repository. With in our group of 4, we were to choose one "team lead" per day. The team lead was not allowed to code but would manage the project and assist the group for the day. Although we had a team lead each day, my team worked independently for the most part. We got together for a few hours each day to assign each member a feature to work and go over our plan for work flow (what branches we should be working on and what files we should work in). If any issues or questions came up, we would message each other in our group chat on Slack. Also, Jasmine bought the group pizza when she was team lead and if thats not a way to lead, than I dont know what is.

My time as team lead was a bit awkward. It was difficult to not code and just help everyone with their features because I was not able to fix my mistakes from the previous night and now someone else was responsible for them. I also ended up being team lead at a strange time. I was technically team lead Thursday night but our group didnt start working on the features until Friday morning which was all good until our class experience a hiccup later that day which shifted the day's productivity. This left me without a feature to work on until Saturday, so I felt kind of useless but tried my best to offer assistance to my group when they needed it.
