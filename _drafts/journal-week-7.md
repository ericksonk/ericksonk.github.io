### Me as Team Lead
* Difficult because I wasnt able to code and fix the things I wanted to fix
* A bit awkward- I was supposed to be team lead thurs night but every one didnt start working on their features until Friday morning, and Friday ended up not being very productive, so I was team lead until they finished those features, and that ended up running into Saturday
 - was able to assist with styling the Listing Options feature and provide a reference to the Etsy API

### Working with Team Lead
* Jasmine bought us pizza
* Our team mostly worked independently, we got together a couple hours each day to assign features and layout our plan (what branches and files we were working on).
  - would message each other if we ran into issues or had questions

Last week we faced a new challenge of working in groups _and_ as a class on the same repository. With in our group of 4, we were to choose one "team lead" per day. The team lead was not allowed to code but would manage the project and assist the group for the day. Although we had a team lead each day, my team worked independently for the most part. We got together for a few hours each day to assign each member a feature to work and go over our plan for work flow (what branches we we should be working on and what files we should work in). If any issues or questions came up, we would message each other in our group chat on Slack.
