### Week 5 Overview
In week 5 we started to explore API's. You might be asking yourself, "WTH is an API?". API stand for Application Programming Interface and is the standard way for software programs to exchange infomation. You can think of an API as the waiter at a restaurant, exchanging information between you and the chef in order to return exactly what you requested. You can extract data from a website's API to assist you in building various programs. I'm still a little fuzzy on how to use API's but it is becoming more clear as we've continue to work with them throughout this week.

The latter part of the week we revisited our old friend, the chessboard. Taking a second go at it I was able to do and understand a lot more than the first time around. I was able to get the model working which was a huge success for me, and although I was not able to connect the view and the model, I still go the model working. Being able to see everyone's chessboard during assignment review helped me better understand what I did wrong and what approaches I should try next time.
