### Week 5 Overview
In week 5 we started to explore API's. You might be asking yourself, "WTH is an API?". API stand for Application Programming Interface and is the standard way for software programs to exchange infomation. You can think of an API as the waiter at a restaurant, exchanging information between you and the chef in order to return exactly what you requested. You can extract data from a website's API to assist you in building various programs. I'm still a little fuzzy on how to use API's but it is becoming more clear as we've continue to work with them throughout this week.
