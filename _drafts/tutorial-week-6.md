# How to Install jQuery
Unfortunately the latest and greatest version of jQuery does not work on all browsers (* coughcough * Internet Explorer). These are the steps you need to take in order to install an IE-friendly version of jQuery.

1.  On the command line type: `bower install jquery#1.*`
1.  In your html file, link to the jQuery library:
  - `<script src="../bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.js"></script>`
