# Week 3 Overview
### CSS
Cascading Style Sheets. Lets you create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. It is utilized by associating rules with HTML elements.
* Each CSS rule is made up of 3 parts:
  1. selector- indicates which element the rule applies to.
  1. property- indicates the aspect of the element you want to change (ex. `color`, `font`, `width`, `height`)
  1. value- specify the settings you want to use for chosen properties (ex. value of color, font-name)
* Box Model- every box has 4 available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance:
	1. `margin`
	1. `border`
	1. `padding`
	1. `content` (`width` & `height`)
