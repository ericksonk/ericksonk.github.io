#### Week 4 Overview
Throughout the course of last week we explored semantic HTML and why it is important. Semantic HTML is the use of the HTML markup to reinforce the _meaning_ of the content on a webpage. These elements are not intended to affect the structure of your web pages, but instead describes the content on your web pages more accurately. Semantic HTML allows other programs like screen readers and search engines to use this information to determain the significance of the content. Examples of semantic HTML elements include `<form>`, `<table>` and `<img>`.


We also began using the CSS preprocessor, SASS (Semantically Awesome StyleSheets), to refactor the CSS we had written for our Blueprint assignments. I personally prefer using SASS. It allows you to write nested rules and cleans up some of the repetitiveness that you encounter while writing CSS.

#### The Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Chessboard
We were assigned to build a chess board and then have it show moves from the opening of the famous Kasparov vs. Karpov game.  Naturally, I got ahead of myself whilst creating the actual board and ended up writing all of my CSS attributes as HTML elements. This would have been the World's Best Chessboard circa 1997. Sadly it's not the 90's anymore and my board had to be destroyed (we _will_ rebuild!). In regards to actually making my board show moves... I didnt get very far, but after David helped us Wednesday night I have a better understanding of what needs to be done and am ready to tackle this beast in Week 5!
