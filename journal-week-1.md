** What do developers do? **
 * use programming languages to create, maintain and improve software

** What principles of a developer have you learned? **

** What is pair programming? **
  * Two programmers work together on one work station
  * Driver- writes the code
  * Observer- reviews each line of code as it is typed

** What kinds of pair programming are there? **
  * Diver-Navigator:
    * Driver controls the imput and focuses on the minute-to-minute coding.
    * Navigator pays attention to the code being written and guides the driver in the right direction.
    * Roles should be switched often
  * Ping-ponging:
    * Both members are writing code frequently
    * Having two input devices makes the process smoother/more efficient
    * First Method: One member takes the role as test writer and the other takes the role of getting the test to pass
     * "test redder" & "test greener"
    * Second Method: "test redder" passes between participants (person1 writes test, person2 makes test green than writes next test, and so on)

** What is test driven development? **
  * test-first development
  * Write a test before writing just enough code to pass that test and refactoring
  * Helps you think through your requirements/design before you write a functional code
  * Helps you write clean code that works
